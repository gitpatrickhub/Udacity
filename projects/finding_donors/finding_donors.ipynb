    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "Random Forest is being used in the stock market to determine potential/expected loss or gain of a stock transaction. It is also being used in the Recommendations space for e-commerce, to suggest to customers other items to buy based on other items they have purchased, viewed and other customers similar to them.\n",

    "**What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?**\n",
    "AdaBoost method can improve the results/accuracy of any given learning algorithm by combining rough and moderately inaccurate rules of thumb. Advantages include being fast to evaluate and can be fast to train, flexibilty to be combined with any weak learner, and can handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest performs well to make predictions for categories with multiple possible values. Another strength is feature selection, being able to examine which variables work best. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?**\n",
    "As with any model, performance depends on the data. It has problems if the weak learners are too complex, overfit or underfit. Adaboost is susceptible to uniform noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest may overfit, especially on smaller data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?**\n",
    "Boosting is a good fit since it can be used in combination with the output of other models to improve the overall performance. Time to train and test the model may be a factor, but since the data set is rather small it may not be a major concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is a good fit because we have multiple features to explore and can utilize feature selection to find the best/most important features. One thing to look out for will be overfitting, which maybe problematic with a smaller data set such as this one. "

    "After updating my code to include the slicing using the actual sample_size being passed in from the for loop in the last section, my results were much different. Prior to running this test, I had suspected that AdaBoost would perform the best, but did not expect the timing impact to be as drastic as shown in this example (nearly 7 times slower). This caused me to try another Ensemble classifier, RandomForest. The timings for RandomForest were much more closely aligned with the other 2 models, although it was still the slowest. I could make an arguement for both Random Forest and Logistic Regression in this case. Both models performed nearly identical on the test data set for both Accuracy and F Score. Random Forest performed better on training data, but as already mentioned was the slowest from a timing perspective. As mentioned as a drawback of Random Forest, the model appears to be overfitting on the training data. I would select Logistic Regression for this case because it performed the best (granted only slightly) on the testing data for Accuracy and F Score. Additionally the timings for Logistic Regression were faster than Random Forest on the Training and was the fastest on Predicting.\n",

    "**prediction/training time**\n",
    "- AdaBoost timing was at best 4 times slower than the next model when predicting and nearly 7 times lower on 100% of the training data. Replacing AdaBoost with RandomForest netted some significant gains in speed for the ensemble classifier, keeping timings sub-second. Logistc Regression was the fastest model predicting the outcome and finished second on training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**the algorithm's suitability for the data**\n",
    "- As mentioned in the previous section, Logistic Regression is a good fit for the data, as we are trying to predict a dichotomous variable(i.e., does someone make more than 50k, yes or no). "

    "A Logistic Regression model is best suited for classification problems, such as trying to classify whether someone makes more than 50k per year or not.  Logistic Regression uses probability to make predictions. The probabilities range from 0-1, 0 = a person does not make more 50k; and 1 = a person makes more than 50k. Any value greater than 0.5, means you can be fairly confident the person makes more than 50k. To come up with the predictions, we have to develop a model using training data. A subset of our data will be saved, or withheld from training, to use for testing our model after training has been completed to validate how well our model performs. Before we can get started we need to transform the data. Any catagorical variable needs to be modified so that the values can be represented as 0 (false) or 1 (true). For example, Sex will be transformed into 2 variables Sex_Male and Sex_Female. Then each variable is evaluated against the variable we are trying to predict to determine the odds. The odds are then used together to determine the final likelihood that someone makes more than 50k. To evaluate how well the model performs we test model with the data we held out or saved for testing. \n"

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
